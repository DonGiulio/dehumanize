Dehumanize
==========

This plug-in adds a new method called 'dehumanize' to the Rails string inflections, roughly the reverse of the built-in 'humanize' method: It lowercases the full string and replaces spaces with underscores. It does not modify hyphens.

Originally built to aid in writing Cucumber examples but probably has other uses.

Example
=======

"Employee salary".dehumanize # => "employee_salary"

Installation
============

script/plugin install git://github.com/andyw8/dehumanize.git
